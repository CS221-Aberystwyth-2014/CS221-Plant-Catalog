connect to database

result = query database -> fetch all recordings

FOREACH(array_keys(fetch assoc(result)) as column_name) {

	output recording data as table row
}

row of the table displaying the information about 1 reserve as well as an option to edit or delete
the reserve.
============================
connect to database

result = query database -> fetch all reserves

FOREACH(array_keys(fetch assoc(result)) as column_name) {
	output column_name as table header
	output table headers for edit and delete
}

free result(result)

result = query database -> fetch all reserves

WHILE(row = fetch assoc(reserves)) {
  	output reserve data as table row
	output button to edit reserve
	output button to delete reserve
}

onClick edit reserve
	redirect to edit reserve page

onClick remove reserve
	query database -> remove reserve
